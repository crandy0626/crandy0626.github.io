            <p>1. In my professional career I want to accomplish being able to create my own game 
that people can play and if tht doesn’t work I want to be a successful programmer in 
any coding company. When it comes to socially, I want to be able to create 
something with my friends because we always talked about being able to do 
something together whether it be a game or story.

but I just hope that it’s something good and very kind.
3. Things I'm passionate about is video games, learning different things about 
technology and helping my friends.
